NYT API Search

[Check it out here!](https://barroncn.github.io/NYT/)

This app is my first use of Web APIs and using AJAX to request JSON data! The user enters a search term, the number of records they would like returned, and start and end dates. The articles they requested are then displayed with the correspoining links to the actual article


Technologies Used:
JavaScript | jQuery | Bootstrap | AJAX | WebAPI
